// The tarotService.ts is now simpler as the primary drawing logic (shuffling and picking)
// will be managed within App.tsx to support one-by-one card draws.
// If more complex deck operations were needed in the future, they could be added here.

// For now, this file can be kept minimal or even removed if no specific tarot logic remains outside App.tsx.
// However, to maintain structure, we'll keep it. It might be useful for future card-related utilities.

// No exports needed for now as drawUniqueCards was the only one.
// If you had other utility functions related to tarot cards (e.g., getting card meanings locally, etc.),
// they would remain here.

export {}; // Ensures the file is treated as a module.
